# 📊 Executive Dashboard – React Application

This is a **React-based Executive Dashboard** created for frontend trainee assignment purposes.  
The application displays multiple dashboard categories, and each category contains widgets that can be dynamically **added**, **removed**, or **searched**.  

The project uses **React functional components** with **Hooks (`useReducer`, `useState`, `useEffect`)** for state management.  
All data and widgets are managed locally within the app without a backend.
